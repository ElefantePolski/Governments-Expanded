 muscovite_manorialism.20.t: "What's Yours Is Mine"

 centralized.23.t: "Legislation and Centralisation"
 centralized.23.d: "The process of centralisation brings up matters that would've been forgotten in outdated legal code and deferred legislation; a tax exemption that expired years ago has been found by an administrator working in this field."
